List of improvements for SciFi GUI;

- Change the show com port/ automatically connect to correct com port

  	 - line 57 ' Application.ser.port = 'COM3'  ' has prior knowledge of relevant port
	 - either finalise computer (and thus port) used and change this line accordingly 
	 - or use use print com port or similar command to automatically adjust used com port 

- Convert distances moved to SI units

- have a stop button in the gui that can stop motion of the motor

- A visual indicator of current position - ie a diagram/ animation that shows where SciFi is (along possible length of movement) and a raw number as well as a proportion of whole distance

- Add 2nd motor to gui

- approximate time of movement (not sure how pracitcal this is)
  	      -  if you put in movement this will say hwo long that movement shold take

- Add motor velocity settings



- finally, he also said that the micro switches (the ones that the motor should bump into at either end) were not working as expected. He held on to them for a few seconds but the motor wouldn't stop instantly. This may be a misundestanding though you should probably speak to Bogdan.
