README for calibration dir in Halla-Online-Tritium

A few guidelines when entering your calibration scripts:

1.) Make sure to add a Reamed that describes in detail how to use the software, and what data files are needed. 

2.) This code needs to work easily on the a-onl machines, using root 6 and analyzer 1.6.

3.) Please do not add generated files to the git repo!
