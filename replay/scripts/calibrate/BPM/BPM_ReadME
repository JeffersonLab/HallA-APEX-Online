BPM ReadME

Works in root 5 as of Summer 17
Works on aonl. Need the enviromental variable "EXPERIMENT"
Would also be nice to have root file directory eviromental variable.

/*     get_bpm_pedestals.c
Using a bpm pedestal run, this code will produce the pedestal locations of the BPMs for both A and B!
In order to use this code, you must add the location and file name of the pedestal run's root file!*/

/*
get_harp_pos.c+
 In order update this code, you must change the date of the Harp scan and the time stamp of each position change.
 These can be found on line 49 and 67!
  
 Also update the CODA run numbers and log book entry numbers for the harp scans. 
  These can be found on line 54 and 55!
  
 Please store the harpscans in the dir HarpScans.  

This is currently limited to running five runs for two harps. This code does have some flaws.
	1. If the harp signals are out of the pre defined bounds, results are incorrect.  These bounds can be 
		manually adjusted by changing the 2D array "HarpLimits". 
	
	2. If the data is too noisy and has many fluctuations, this can cause the fits to be incorrect.
		One might like to un comment the canvas delete line in order to investigate 
		the Fit Functions for each run. This may be found on line 326

/*
BPM_calibration
 In order to update this code, please do the following
	-Update the pedestals
	-Update the harp results file name and location.
	-Update the root file location for the rootfiles from the harp scans. 
	-Make sure to double check the name of the BPM raw current branches. This currently
		uses Lrb and Rrb.

How to calibrate the BPMs!!

1. Using a BPM pedestal run, Run get_bpm_pedestals.c in root with the command 
'.x get_bpm_pedestals.c'. You may also pass the run number and side as an argument.
.x get_bpm_pedestals.c(run#, 'L/R') ' 

2.Use the new pedestal values to update the pedestals in the BPM_calibration.c script.
	(currently on line 86)

3. Update get_harp_pos.c, with the date, time stamp, CODA run#, accelerator run# and location of the harp scan txt files.

4. Run get_harp_pos.c in root with the command '.x get_harp_pos.c'

5. Update BPM_calibration.c, with new file name and location of harp results, and file location of the root files associated to the harp runs. 

6. Run BPM_calibration.c in root with the command '.x BPM_calibration.c' 
	You can run with the arguments for which HRS (L/R) and quite mode (0/1). 
	.x BPM_calibration.c('L/R' , 0/1) defalts are R and quite. 

7. Enter the new BPM calibration constant into the DB at 
	/adaqfs/home/a-onl/rastersize/RightHRS/DB/db_rb.beamline.dat
