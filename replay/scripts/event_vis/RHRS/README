	Event visualization for HRS detectors using vpython

=============================================================

##################
## REQUIREMENTS ##
##################

	Python
	vpython module
	PyROOT

## OVERVIEW ##
##############

Code for building an individual detector (e.g. shower, preshower) is contained in the script: 

	detector.py

detector.py contains the definition of a function:

	build_detector()

Build functions for all detectors should be imported to the main function:

	from detector import build_detector

If the detector is dynamic (i.e., changes appearance to represent event data), the build_detector function must return the object (or array of objects) that constitute that detector.  Adjusting the appearance of detectors is done in the main function. 

The main function is RHRS_event_vis.py.  It takes one (required) argument, the path of a ROOT file to visualize events from.

###############################
## RUNNING THE VISUALIZATION ##
###############################

To run the visualization, execute:

	python RHRS_event_vis.py /path/to/rootfile.root


There are three options the user may wish to adjust in RHRS_event_vis.py

1. scene.center = vector(x, y, z)

This sets the position the camera is centered on.  Please note that positions are in transport coordinates.

2. ALL_ACTIVE = Bool

This sets which VDC wires will be displayed.  If True, all active wires are displayed.  If False, only wires that are part of clusters will be displayed.

3. evCuts 

This sets the cuts that are used to build the event list.
