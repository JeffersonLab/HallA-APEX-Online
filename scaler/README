How to build xscaler executable:
    -This must be done if any changes are made to the files creating the scaler GUI.
    -This also needs to be done if the version of ROOT being used is changed.

Step 1 Building libdc_local.a: 
     -Note: This step is only needed to build libdc.a and place it in the hana_scaler directory as libdc_local.a. If libdc_local.a already exists in the hana_scaler directory this step may be skipped (although it may be needed if the ROOT version changed).
     -cd to the hana_decode directory.
     -type "make clean" to remove the old files. 
     -type "make". This will build libdc.a
     -cp libdc.a to the hana_scaler directory and rename it libdc_local.a

Step 2 Building xscaler executable:
     -cd to the hana_scaler directory.
     -type "make clean" to remove the old files. 
     -type "make". This will build the xscaler executable.
     -cp the xscaler executable to the /adaqfs/home/a-onl/tritium/scaler directory.

Step 3 Running the Scaler GUI:
     -In the /adaqfs/home/a-onl/tritium/scaler directory type "./xscaler LEFT" to open up the scaler GUI for the LHRS or use "./xscaler RIGHT" for the RHRS.
